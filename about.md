Hi, my name is Viktor Weber. Currently student at the Luebeck's technical highschool. I am studying IT and currently at my 4th semester of Master of Science. 

### More Information

I am a vivid gamer. Started playing games at around the age of 4. Always loved, love and will love games. Though with the time the interest shifts more and more.  
Right now I am also interested in **3D Design**. First started using *Blender* and then moved towards *Maya* for modeling. Also use *Substance Painter* and *Substance Designer* for texturing. Although I just started using it, so I am really still at the **very beginner level**. Once I get more and more stuff done, will most likely post it on my blog.
